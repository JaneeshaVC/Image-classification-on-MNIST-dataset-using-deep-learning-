# Image-classification-on-MNIST-dataset-using-deep-learning-
This project focuses on classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using a neural network model. 
The MNIST dataset is a benchmark in machine learning, containing 70,000 grayscale images of digits (0â€“9) sized 28x28 pixels. 
The goal of this project is to build, train, and evaluate a model that accurately recognizes these digits. 
It serves as a foundational exercise in computer vision and deep learning, leveraging tools such as TensorFlow/PyTorch and standard preprocessing techniques.
